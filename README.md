# calebs-code-vault

This repo contains some code I snagged from a Pluralsight course. And I'm using it to help teach my son Caleb to build and run code using Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

There's four C# patterns I want to create practice code with. These are common patterns I've seen used in real world application code at my job.

1. Dependency Injection
2. Repository
3. Factory
4. Decorator
